= How much does it cost to use the plugin? =

You will need to set up a credit card so that Cryptum will charge a sales fee on each crypto payment received (Checkout) and on each completed NFT sale (NFT Plugin).

= How does the sale and transfer of NFTs work? =

Create your collections and NFTs on the Dashboard, using your blockchain wallet. Then, link your NFTs in the dashboard with the products from your store (in the Woo! dashboard).
